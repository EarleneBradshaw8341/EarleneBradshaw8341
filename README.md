## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer specializing in building clean, efficient, and reproducible machine learning pipelines using scikit-learn and Pandas. This project reflects my end-to-end approach to data-driven problem solvingâ€”from raw data ingestion to model evaluation and deployment-ready outputs.

At the foundation of these pipelines is data wrangling, where I use Pandas to load, clean, and structure datasets for analysis. Missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers are systematically handled through custom preprocessing scripts and scikit-learn-compatible transformers. Whether working with tabular data, time-series datasets, or categorical-heavy inputs, I apply a consistent methodology to ensure data integrity and usability.

Feature engineering is a core focus throughout the project. I leverage both built-in and custom transformers to generate informative features, including one-hot encoding, scaling, binning, interaction terms, and domain-specific aggregations. Each transformation is encapsulated within scikit-learnâ€™s Pipeline or ColumnTransformer, ensuring modularity, reproducibility, and compatibility with model tuning workflows.

Model selection and evaluation are conducted using cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (via GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV), and a suite of performance metrics appropriate to the task (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC, or RMSE). The pipelines support easy experimentation with various algorithmsâ€”from decision trees and ensemble models to logistic regression and support vector machines.

This repository is designed for clarity and reuse, whether you're exploring supervised learning tasks, refining feature sets, or validating model performance. Itâ€™s ideal for data scientists, engineers, or students looking for hands-on examples of production-ready ML workflows using Pythonâ€™s most trusted libraries.
